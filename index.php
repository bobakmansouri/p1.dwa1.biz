    <h1>  Babak Mansouri</h1>  
	<p> <strong>Small Bio: </strong> I live in Washington DC metro area and work as a systems engineer. I have a software engineering degree and have been on and off coding since 1993. My last attempt to become a full time application developer goes back to 2003 that I worked as a JSP/J2EE developer for a year. Around the same time I developed a few PHP/MySQL websites in my spare time. And that was it! As I donâ€™t want to let go of my passion I use VBScript, PowerShell and Wise Script for logon scripts and maintaining systems and servers since it makes my job much easier.</p>

	<p>I am very excited about this course and want to learn Ajax/jQuery/Git/PHP. I want to pursue a graduate degree in Information Management Systems at Harvard Extension School and this is the first course I am taking.</p>

	<p>In my spare time I spend time with my two daughters (6 and 2 years old), take my bicycle for a ride and if anytime is left I play guitar.</p> 
 
 	<p> <strong>Text Editor: </strong> Sublime Text 2 - and I love it.</p>
